Why am I being asked these questions?

These questions don't correspond to any metrics, but your answers to them will be presented to companies directly for their review. 

If you complete them, these questions help us show a more complete picture of your skillset, demonstrating to companies that you can design and scale systems in addition to possessing the coding competencies you've demonstrated through other sections.

System Design

Let's expand on the light rail app from part 2. Imagine that your MPV (minimal valuable product) was successful and the city wants you to cover more routes, including bus routes. Specifically, you need to ensure that 1) your system can handle at least 1000 routes with different schedules and 2) all passengers can access the service from any device (including mobile) and get a response within 500 msec. Consider this to be your service-level agreement (SLA).

At a high level, describe how you would design and build such a system. Be specific in terms of calculating expected throughput in order to meet the SLA requirements, and how you would scale the system to meet the requirements. Think about how would you take advantage of multiple machines when scaling the system. Specifically, you may distribute the load accross the machines in whatever manner you prefer.

Feel free to make reasonable assumptions; the details are deliberately underspecified. You can focus your discussion on the parts that you think are the most interesting.

Attach Diagram (optional)

Feel free to provide a URL to a hand drawn diagram that you used for System Design challenge. We will show cases it to the employers along with the solution. Please verify that the URL is accessible.
