Solution Analysis

You solved the challenge. Now imagine that you need to present your solution to your development team. How would you describe your approach?

Basically the problem decomposes like a tree algorithm with left/right, min(a,b), etc, choices being made at every turn. These are done in a functional manner so that the end result: least distance, is calculated without needing to do much extra work than simply iterating a collection of items.



What is the time complexity of your solution?

O(n): basically for the time cost of iterating one (or several) lists of items.



What is the space compexity of your solution?

O(n): the collections contributing to time complexity are also contributing to space complexity.
